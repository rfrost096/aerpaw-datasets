    description: "This dataset comprises aerial RF and throughput measurements from a non-standalone 5G network operating in the C-band, conducted using the AERPAW testbed. The infrastructure spans two primary locations: NC State University's Centennial campus, simulating an urban environment, and the Lake Wheeler site, reflecting a rural agricultural setting. Both locations are equipped to provide comprehensive 4G and 5G coverage. \n\n The experimental setup featured a 5G NSA system with overlaid NR and LTE sectors, utilizing dual cross-polarized directional antennas with a 120-degree azimuth beam width. Measurements were performed using a portable node mounted on a UAV, equipped with a Quectel 5G modem module and a LattePanda companion computer. The UAV followed a predefined zigzag flight path at 30 meters altitude, capturing data on RF parameters like RSRP and SINR, as well as application layer performance metrics like throughput.\n\nThe primary focus was on examining the impact of antenna configurations and UAV 3D movement patterns on the RF signal characteristics and network throughput under varied environmental conditions at both urban and rural sites."

    description: "A UAV carrying two UEs: a Samsung S23 with Keysight Nemo, and a Samsung S21 with PawPrints, was flown in a zig-zag manner, with each sweep at an increasing distance from a private Ericsson AERPAW base station. Nemo logged detailed 4G and 5G cellular KPIs, and these logs were correlated with the UAV’s position based on timestamps. The KPIs include channel rank and channel quality index. Both phones were connected as IPerf clients to an IPerf server. The IPerf server was connected to the Ericsson base station."
